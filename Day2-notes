Benefits of DevOps
================

	1. Technical benefits 

	Ø Faster deployments 
	Ø Automated & consistent env
	Ø Reduced manual errors 
	Ø Rapid bug fixes 
	Ø Highly scalable infrastructure 
	Ø Self-healing systems 


	2. Business benefits 

	Ø Faster time to market 
	Ø Higher customers satisfaction 
	Ø Lower down time 
	Ø Predictable releases 
	Ø Better cost efficiency 
	Ø Increased innovation



Key principles of DevOps
====================

	1. Collaboration & Shared ownership:- Dev+qa+Ops(Devops)
	2. Automation First:- Build + Test + Deploy infra provision is automated 
	3. Continuous Everything:- continues integration, Continues testing, continuous deployment and delivery , continuous monitoring 
	4. Infrastructure as Code(IAC) :- infra is version controlled, testable, reproducible  (terraform, ansible, cloud formation).
	5. Shift Left :- security, testing, quality are moved earlier in sdlc.
	6. Observability:- Tracing, logs, metrics , real time feedback loops( SRE)
	7. Fail fast and learn fast :- frequent small releases reduce risk.

Git
===

	Ø It is tool 
	Ø It is nothing version control system
	Ø Its completely free 
	Ø We can install where ever want


Why Git?
========
 
	Ø To track code changes
	Ø It is versionble

Prerequisites 
===========

	Ø Install git bash on ur local server
	Ø Create one github account
	Ø You have to configure github credentials
